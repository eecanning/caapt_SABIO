            <h1> RandomEngine v0 </h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
            	As the name suggests: an engine that assigns <span>random</span> scores to objects and
		<span>random</span> scores to the words that make up an object's meta text. <br>
                This engine is part of <span>SABIO</span> because it highlights the idea that tools for
		the navigation of bias also need to be disruptive (in contrast to being focused on a task).
		Further, any engine also brings its own biases that might shadow or distract from 
		bias in the collection. The <span>random</span> engine is arguably the least biased and the most disruptive
		engine possible. We therefore encourage you to play with the <span>random</span> engine as well and
		to compare what you find to the other engines. 
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality</h3>
		<p>
			Very simple: for each object produces a <span>random</span> score (between 0 and 1). 
			Then, as evidence, it picks <span>random</span> words from the object's texts and assigns
			<span>random</span> scores to these words.
		</p>		



	    <h3>Interpretation of Outputs</h3>
            <p>
		Because all the scores are completely <span>random</span>, the results from this engine
		have no real interpretation. There is one interesting phenomenon, however, that emerges
		from <span>random</span>ness: You might notice, that certain objects and words come up more prominently
		(often) than others; these are the most frequent objects/words in the collection
		and the <span>random</span> engine "floats them to the top". This is because if everything is chosen at <span>random</span>, 
		very frequent elements naturally have a higher chance of being selected. 	
            </p>
            <h3>Parameters</h3>
            <p>
                This engine only has a nonce parameter because the engine actually needs no parameters
		at all; the nonce parameter therefore has no function.
		
            </p>
            
            <h3>If you're interested in the technical details&hellip;</h3>
            <p><span>Randomness</span> is a beautiful concept that is not yet fully understood -
            because it evades definition whenever people try to define it (much like trying to 
            define nothingness) - but nonetheless a concept without which
            computer science and AI wouldn't be what they are today. 
            Moreover, <span>randomness</span> is all over the universe and our daily lives,
            from tossing dice to the arrangement of stars across galaxies.
