            <h1> Typicality Engine v0 </h1>
            <p>
                The typicality engine uses the probability of the language attached to an object. This probability is in a linguistic sense: If the title, decription, etc of an object contains sentences, phrases, words that are common in the collection as a whole, this object will have a high linguistic probability. 
            </p>
            <h3> If you are interested in the technical details&hellip;</h3>
            <p>Read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram">n-grams</a> for the interpolation of probabilities from shorter, overlapping phrases in sentences and about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_set">typicality</a> for the measure computed from the n-gram probabilities of texts (such as titles and descriptions).</p>
