# SABIO Project Plan



## Practical Work a.k.a. Programming
 - process the meta-data network, automate common patterns
 - gather basic characterstics of the dataset -> will point towards types of methods, might reveal problems that need to be be addressed
 - do some basic experiments such as term tracking, dependency parsing, etc -> will restrict and/or guide the choice of algorithms
 - pre-process the linguistic data, the objects' descriptions, including vectorisation


## Theoretical Work a.k.a. Conceptual Analysis and Formalisation

 - map experts' perspectives on social bias (domain experts are philosophers, social scientists, activists, *anyone but me*):
   - get a workable definition which can be translated into linguistic/statistical properties
   - define boundaries of bias in opposition to other concepts
   
 - manifesto: carefully explicate our own goals and requirements to (1) be judged against and (2) make process transparent and reproducible

 - review previous work: 
   - already identified domains, problems and formalisations 
   - inspiration from methods already in use
   - off-the-shelf algorithms and libraries
   - limitations 
   
 - formalise the world of biases (types, aspects, levels) to be detected in the first iteration 
   
&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;=> goal for February: be ready to implement a battery of detection algorithms for experimentation and feedback from the stakeholders
