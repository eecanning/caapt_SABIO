For now, this README is just a place to drop random ideas for the project. Later, it will be turned into a proper guide to the theoretical parts of SABIO.
 
 
## Social Bias versus Statistical Bias

It is not really a coincidence that both statisticians and social scientists speak of bias. 
In statistics, bias is a type of systematic difference of an estimator from the true value; formally, the expected value of a statistic *T* can be expressed as *E[T] = \theta + bias(\theta)*  and *T* is unbiased iff *bias(\theta) = 0*. 
In social science, bias (**WHAT IS SOCIAL BIAS EXACTLY?**).

## Test Data
  
  
  Is there a way to obtain test data, to be able to make the successfulness/appropriateness of whatever approaches we choose/develop measurable?
  This could be data created and/or annotated by others, or our own data measured along some proxy (or both).
  
  Assuming that there is no data annotated for bias itself, a possible sketch could be:  
    
  
  
## Language without Bias?

Quantifying bias has a similar problem as the quantification of laws (e.g. Zipf's) in language: Because they are intrinsic properties of language, it is impossible to imagine languages where bias or laws (such as Zipf's) don't exist. The very practical problem arises then that a measured value of quantification becomes somewhat meaningless because it has no "null" point that it can be studied in comparison of. (I.e. what does a biasedness value of 10 mean if I don't know what the sample would need to look like to obtain a value of 0.)
