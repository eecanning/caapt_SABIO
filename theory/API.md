# API Specification

(1) bias is a ubiqitous and conplex phenomenon, it can pervade given (heterogeneous) data set at all levels, scales and dimensions  
(2) primarity because of (1), SABIO implements bias detection not as a monolithic algorithms but as collections of (preferrably, for introspection) simple algorithms  

Because of (1), algorithms will operate on diverse types on input representations and similarly differ vastly in their output types; because of (2), i.e. the project's modular structure, algorithms will be added and replaced as an integral part of the development procedure. These reasons make it both important and useful to have clearly defined API, (1) for guiding the implementation of new algorithms, (2) to make SABIO transferrable to other sources of data and (3) to facilitate versatile and powerful user interfaces and visualisations.
