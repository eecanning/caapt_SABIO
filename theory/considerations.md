# Things to Consider

Detecting bias in texts of cultural signifcance, in particular with the aim to increase inclusivity in society, 
requires special care when designing detection algorithms. Therefore, below an incomplete and unordered list of things to be kept in mind.

It could be read as a kind of manifest.


## Transparency

Requirement 1: Users must be able to understand *why* a certain decision was made, i.e. given which prior information or according to which metric bias was detected/
not detected.

Requirement 2: User must be able to understand *where* a certain decision was made, i.e. which parts of the input lead the algorithm to detect/not detect bias.


## Scalability & Reproducibility

The strategies/algorithms designed in the scope of this project will likely only be able to address certain types and aspects of bias, e.g. be limited to bias against
specific populations within society, and will have to ingore others.

Requirement 1: The algorithms will have be readily adapted to biases that were not addressed in this project.

Requirement 2: The algorithms must clearly define their own borders in scope, i.e. if a certain type/aspect of bias was not explicitly addressed, then the algorithms
should stay clear of it and not detect it.
