# Domain Experts

*Who are domain experts?*  
Given the initial focus and scope of, this is everyone in the **union** of

 - people generally working with the museums' collections: curators, managers, researchers (sociology, history, anthropologists, ethnographers, etc)
 - researchers, activists & others who deal with bias by tracking, investigating, interpreting it in and across cultural collections

I.e. anyone who works with heritage collections as a 'user', has bias as a subject in their work or both.
