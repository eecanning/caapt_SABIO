Call with the SABIO stakeholders:

- [Example tool by Sudox](https://share.sudox.nl/words-matter/), apparently marks potentially problematic words and computes an overall sentence score based on the ratio of such words.  

- [Words Matter](https://www.materialculture.nl/en/publications/words-matter)


Forwarded by Marieke:

- [Google Article](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/04/a-scalable-approach-to-reducing-gender.html) on addressing gender bias in Google Translate

- the [CRAPL License](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/) for software & related resources written in academic contexts




### Jan 20

Chat with Corey:

 - [Lukas Koster](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/k/o/l.koster/l.koster.html): Group leader of library & information systems at UvA -> Corey can establish a connection
 
 - AI4LAM (e.g. [their GitHub](https://github.com/AI4LAM) or [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/view/ai4lam/working-groups?authuser=0)), a group on AI for Libraries, Archives and Museums -> Corey is a member and will keep his eyes open for us, relatedly, Marieke mentioned [LODLAM](https://lod-lam.net/) a group on Linked Open Data for LAM
 <br> [Conference organised by AI4LAM](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/fantastic-futures)
 
 - there was a workshop at NeurIPS 2020 named [Navigating the Broader Impacts of AI Research](https://nbiair.com/) -> found after searching for the ethics debate at NeurIPS 2020 (see e.g. [this Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00160-y))
 
 - the [Algorhtmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/), garnered a lot of attention following their exposal of racial bias in facial recognition systems

 - [Article by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) on racial bias in criminal prediction software 
used in the US

 - [FAccT Conference](https://facctconference.org/) ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency -> Corey mentioned this a potential place for networking

 - [DCode Network](https://www.dcode-network.eu/), project for 'design as a way to open pathways toward inclusive and sustainable futures' -> probably interesting for the user-interface side of SABIO 



### Jan 27

Meeting with Richard van Alphen from Tropenmuseum:

  - item description are curated when digitised; provenance trail is however available
  - item **titles** are digitised without change, so the their time of creation likely matches the item's indicated year  
  - RDF dumps download page: https://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/thesaurus/#/query/461bb885-56de-4ab0-b28f-1c00e8e3b4e6 -> move to [data](/data)
  - will talk to his people about getting access to their DB to be able to query it directly and get back to us


SABIO/AI:CULT Kick-off meeting:

  - Jesse de Vos from B&G has been part of a project on bias; he had the following notes:
    - what about the bias that manifests in the gaps of the museums' collections? bias as gaps?
    - they found it useful to speak of *framing* rather than of *bias* and to distinguish *thematic* and *episodic* framing
  - [Markus Bakenhol](https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/cms/en/medewerkers/142839-markusb), postdoc in ethnology at Meertens, is a domain expert
  - Johan mentioned the [Inward Outward symposium](https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/inwardoutward) as an outlet and place to get in touch with others 
  - Johan asked if we could find any published benchmarks or competitions (perhaps at Kaggle?), or even publish one ourselves? => benchmarking is a good point!
  - the [Europeana Challenge](https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-europeanatech-challenge-for-europeana-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-datasets) which we'll potentially go for ([shared document?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TbHuN3Fcdgmh5n_9MGolh89N7uQ4fGDoI9mIHvIszWM/edit))
  - abstract to be submitted at the [LIBER Conference](https://liberconference.eu/liber-2021-online-call-for-papers/); this [shared doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQlUB5bDVZwTBGTgculT5Lk13l1ZSf7qvoN60IariFI/edit) contains the abstract

Mattia's (cultural analyst) intuition, depending on definitions of course, is that bias is opposed polyvocality: bias is nurtured by the lack of voices and conversely put, a diversity of voices makes bias unlikely to prevail <br>
=> Marieke agrees with the gist of this position
https://narrativeinitiative.org/blog/polyvocal-narrative-strategy-turning-many-voices-into-durable-change/


[The Portrait of a Lady: Close and distant reading of media gender bias](https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/29761): abstract for a paper by Laura Hollink on quantifying (binary) gender bias in Dutch newspaper; the approach takes advantage of the lexicalised marking of gender in Dutch (hij/zij) and measures bias as the degree to which an algorithm can predict gender; predicition is *not* done on the pure text but on features extracted based on previous conceptual work 


### Jan 29

Marieke mentioned [ARIAS](https://arias.amsterdam/), a 'Platform for Research through the Arts and Sciences', that has grants for work sitting at the interesection of art and science


there is the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](plato.stanford.edu), it has entries e.g. on [Feminist Epistemology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/), [race](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/), [implicit bias](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicit-bias/) => really good reference, commonly used by philosophers and very accessible
